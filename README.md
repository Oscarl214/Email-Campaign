## Description

A html coded email dedicated for the marketing of my app CrowdQuery. Personal project to touch up on my HTML and CSS while also taking a dip into email developing.

Currently the email works on most email clients. Still working on a workaround for the gmail app client as shown in the images.

## Business Case

The Problem: Advertising my Application.

Email Works to be used for my marketing campaign when I am ready to deploy.
